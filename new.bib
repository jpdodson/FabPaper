However, such qubits with complete electrical control and fidelities above the threshold for quantum error correction have not yet been achieved. We show theoretically that the threshold fidelity can be achieved with ac gate operation of the quantum dot hybrid qubit. Formed by three electrons in a double dot, this qubit is electrically controlled, does not require magnetic fields, and runs at GHz gate speeds. We analyze the decoherence caused by 1/f charge noise in this qubit, find parameters that minimize the charge noise dependence in the qubit frequency, T and determine the optimal working points for ac gate operations that drive the detuning and tunnel coupling.},

	Abstract = {Like modern microprocessors today, future processors of quantum information may be implemented using all- electrical control of silicon-based devices. A semiconductor spin qubit may be controlled without the use of magnetic fields by using three electrons in three tunnel-coupled quantum dots. Triple dots have previously been implemented in GaAs, but this material suffers from intrinsic nuclear magnetic noise. Reduction of this noise is possible by fabricating devices using isotopically purified silicon. We demonstrate universal coherent control of a triple-quantum-dot qubit implemented in an isotopically enhanced Si/SiGe heterostructure. Composite pulses are used to implement spin-echo-type sequences, and differential charge sensing enables single-shot state readout. These experiments demonstrate sufficient control with sufficiently low noise to enable the long pulse sequences required for exchange-only two-qubit logic and randomized benchmarking.},

	Abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate a hybrid qubit in a GaAs double quantum dot. The qubit is encoded in the (1, 4) charge regime of the double dot, and can be manipulated completely electrically. The qubit has frequencies that fall conveniently within the microwave range. More importantly, a dot anharmonicity leads to quasi-parallel energy levels and a new anti-crossing, which help preserve quantum coherence of the qubit and yield a useful working point. We have performed Larmor precession and Ramsey fringe experiments near the new working point, and find that the qubit decoherence time is significantly improved over a charge qubit. This work shows a new way to encode a semiconductor logical qubit that is controllable and coherent.},

	Abstract = {The author analyzes quantum computation with the hybrid qubit (HQ) that is encoded using the three-electron configuration of a double quantum dot. All gate operations are controlled with electric signals, while the qubit remains at an optimal operation point that is insensitive to noise. An effective single-qubit description is derived, and two-qubit interactions are suggested using Coulomb and exchange interactions. Universal quantum control is described and numerically simulated using realistic parameters for HQs in Si and GaAs. High-fidelity quantum computing at the threshold of quantum error correction is possible if the Coulomb interactions between the HQs stay weak.},

@article{Veldhorst:2015je,
	Abstract = {Quantum computation requires qubits that can be coupled in a scalable manner, together with universal and high-fidelity one- and two-qubit logic gates1,2. Many physical realizations of qubits exist, including single photons3, trapped ions4, superconducting cir- cuits5, single defects or atoms in diamond6,7 and silicon8, and semi- conductor quantum dots9, with single-qubit fidelities that exceed the stringent thresholds required for fault-tolerant quantum com- puting10. Despite this, high-fidelity two-qubit gates in the solid state that can be manufactured using standard lithographic tech- niques have so far been limited to superconducting qubits5, owing to the difficulties of coupling qubits and dephasing in semi- conductor systems11--13. Here we present a two-qubit logic gate, which uses single spins in isotopically enriched silicon14 and is realized by performing single- and two-qubit operations in a quantum dot system using the exchange interaction, as envisaged in the Loss--DiVincenzo proposal2. We realize CNOT gates via controlled-phase operations combined with single-qubit opera- tions. Direct gate-voltage control provides single-qubit address- ability, together with a switchable exchange interaction that is used in the two-qubit controlled-phase gate. By independently reading out both qubits, we measure clear anticorrelations in the two-spin probabilities of the CNOT gate.},

	Abstract = {Building upon the demonstration of coherent control and single-shot readout of the electron and nuclear spins of individual 31P atoms in silicon, we present here a systematic experimental estimate of quantum gate fidelities using randomized benchmarking of 1-qubit gates in the Clifford group. We apply this analysis to the electron and the ionized 31P nucleus of a single P donor in isotopically purified 28Si. We find average gate fidelities of 99.95% for the electron and 99.99% for the nuclear spin. These values are above certain error correction thresholds and demonstrate the potential of donor-based quantum computing in silicon. By studying the influence of the shape and power of the control pulses, we find evidence that the present limitation to the gate fidelity is mostly related to the external hardware and not the intrinsic behaviour of the qubit.},

	Abstract = {We implement resonant single qubit operations on a semiconductor hybrid qubit hosted in a three-electron Si/SiGe double quantum dot structure. By resonantly modulating the double dot energy detuning and employing electron tunnelling-based readout, we achieve fast (4100 MHz) Rabi oscillations and purely electrical manipulations of the three-electron spin states. We demonstrate universal single qubit gates using a Ramsey pulse sequence as well as microwave phase control, the latter of which shows control of an arbitrary rotation axis on the X--Y plane of the Bloch sphere. Quantum process tomography yields Ï€ rotation gate fidelities higher than 93 (96)% around the X (Z) axis of the Bloch sphere. We further show that the implementation of dynamic decoupling sequences on the hybrid qubit enables coherence times longer than 150 ns.},

	Abstract = {We demonstrate a substantial improvement in the spin-exchange gate using symmetric control instead of conventional detuning in GaAs spin qubits, up to a factor of six increase in the quality factor of the gate. For symmetric operation, nanosecond voltage pulses are applied to the barrier that controls the interdot potential between quantum dots, modulating the exchange interaction while maintaining symmetry between the dots. Excellent agreement is found with a model that separately includes electrical and nuclear noise sources for both detuning and symmetric gating schemes. Unlike exchange control via detuning, the decoherence of symmetric exchange rotations is dominated by rotation-axis fluctuations due to nuclear field noise rather than direct exchange noise.},
