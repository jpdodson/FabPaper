	Abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to examine how thermal transport is affected by the presence of one or more interfaces. Parameters such as film thickness, the ratio of respective material composition, the number of interfaces per unit length, and lattice strain are considered. Results indicate that for simple nanoscale strained heterostructures containing a single interface, the effective thermal conductivity may be less than half the value of an average of the thermal conductivities of the respective unstrained thin films. Increasing the number of interfaces per unit length, however, does not necessarily result in a corresponding decrease in the effective thermal conductivity of the superlattice.},

We find that relaxation is mediated by the spin-orbit interaction, and by manipulating the orbital states of the dot using gate voltages we vary the relaxation rate W equivalent to T-1(-1) by over an order of magnitude. The dependence of W on orbital confinement agrees with theoretical predictions, and from these data we extract the spin-orbit length. We also measure the dependence of W on the magnetic field and demonstrate that spin-orbit mediated coupling to phonons is the dominant relaxation mechanism down to 1 T, where T-1 exceeds 1 s.},

By applying negative voltages to these gates the underlying electron gas is depleted and a lateral quantum dot is formed, the size of which can be adjusted by the gate voltage. We observe single-electron operation with Coulomb blockade behavior below 1 K. Gate leakage currents are well controlled, indicating that the recently encountered problems with Schottky gates for this type of application are not an inherent limitation of modulation-doped Si/SiGe heterostructures, as had been speculated.

	Abstract = {A novel three- layer microfluidic polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS) device was constructed with two fluid chambers that holds a brain slice in place with microposts while maintaining laminar perfusate flow above and below the slice. Our fabrication technique permits rapid production of PDMS layers that can be applied to brain slices of different shapes and sizes. In this study, the device was designed to fit the shape and thickness ( 530 - 700 mu m) of a medullary brain slice taken from P0 - P4 neonatal rats. Medullary slices in this chamber spontaneously produced rhythmic, respiratory- related motor output for up to 3 h, thereby demonstrating that brain slice viability was maintained for prolonged periods. This design is unique in that it achieves independent control of fluids through multiple channels in two separate fluid chambers. The laminar flow exhibited by the microfluidic chamber allows controlled solutions to target specific areas of the brain slice based on the input flow rates. To demonstrate this capability, a stream of Na+- free solution was focused on one half of a medullary slice to abolish spontaneous neural activity in only that half of the brain slice, while the other half remained active. We also demonstrated that flow of different solutions can be focused over the midline of the brain slice. The multilayer brain slice chamber design can integrate several traditional types of electrophysiology tools that are commonly used to measure neurophysiological properties of brain slices. Thus, this new microfluidic chamber is advantageous for experiments that involve controlled drug or solution delivery at high spatiotemporal resolution.},

	Abstract = {A theory based on localized-orbital approaches is developed to describe the valley splitting observed in silicon quantum wells. The theory is appropriate in the limit of low electron density and relevant for quantum computing architectures. The valley splitting is computed for realistic devices using the quantitative nanoelectronic modeling tool NEMO. A simple, analytically solvable tight-binding model reproduces the behavior of the splitting in the NEMO results and yields much physical insight. The splitting is in general nonzero even in the absence of electric field in contrast to previous works. The splitting in a square well oscillates as a function of S, the number of layers in the quantum well, with a period that is determined by the location of the valley minimum in the Brillouin zone. The envelope of the splitting decays as S-3. The feasibility of observing such oscillations experimentally in Si/SiGe heterostructures is discussed. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Wave-particle duality, as manifest in the two-slit experiment, provides perhaps the most vivid illustration of Bohr's complementarity principle: wave-like behaviour (interference) occurs only when the different possible paths a particle can take are indistinguishable, even in principle(1). The introduction of a which path (welcher Weg) detector for determining the actual path taken by the particle inevitably involved coupling the particle to a measuring environment, which in turn results in dephasing (suppression of interference). In other words, simultaneous observations of wave and particle behaviour is prohibited. Such a manifestation of the complementarity principle was demonstrated recently using a pair of correlated photons, with measurement of one photon being used to determine the path taken by the other and so prevent single-photon interference(2). Here we report the dephasing effects of a which-path detector on electrons traversing a double-path interferometer. We find that by varying the sensitivity of the detector we can affect the visibility of the oscillatory interference signal, thereby verifying the complementarity principle for fermions.},

@article{Canny:1986p679,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a computational approach to edge detection. The success of the approach depends on the definition of a comprehensive set of goals for the computation of edge points. These goals must be precise enough to delimit the desired behavior of the detector while making minimal assumptions about the form of the solution. We define detection and localization criteria for a class of edges, and present mathematical forms for these criteria as functionals on the operator impulse response. A third criterion is then added to ensure that the detector has only one response to a single edge. We use the criteria in numerical optimization to derive detectors for several common image features, including step edges. On specializing the analysis to step edges, we find that there is a natural uncertainty principle between detection and localization performance, which are the two main goals. With this principle we derive a single operator shape which is optimal at any scale. The optimal detector has a simple approximate implementation in which edges are marked at maxima in gradient magnitude of a Gaussian-smoothed image. We extend this simple detector using operators of several widths to cope with different signal-to-noise ratios in the image. We present a general method, called feature synthesis, for the fine-to-coarse integration of information from operators at different scales. Finally we show that step edge detector performance improves considerably as the operator point spread function is extended along the edge.},

	Abstract = {Polydiacetylenes (PDAs) form a unique class of polymeric materials that couple highly aligned and conjugated backbones with tailorable pendant sidegroups and terminal functionalities. They can be structured in the form of bulk materials, multilayer and monolayer films, polymerized vesicles, and even incorporated into inorganic host matrices to form nanocomposites. The resulting materials exhibit an array of spectacular properties, beginning most notably with dramatic chromogenic transitions that can be activated optically, thermally, chemically, and mechanically. Recent studies have shown that these transitions can even be controlled and observed at the nanometre scale. These transitions have been harnessed for the purpose of chemical and biomolecular sensors, and on a more fundamental level have led to new insights regarding chromogenic phenomena in polymers. Other recent studies have explored how the strong structural anisotropy that these materials possess leads to anisotropic nanomechanical behaviour. These recent advances suggest that PDAs could be considered as a potential component in nanostructured devices due to the large number of tunable properties. In this paper, we provide a succinct review of the latest insights and applications involving PDA. We then focus in more detail on our work concerning ultrathin films, specifically structural properties, mechanochromism, thermochromism, and in-plane mechanical anisotropy of PDA monolayers. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and fluorescence microscopy confirm that films 1-3 monolayers thick can be organized into highly ordered domains, with the conjugated backbones parallel to the substrate. The number of stable layers is controlled by the head-group functionality. Local mechanical stress applied by AFM and near-field optical probes induces the chromogenic transition in the film at the nanometre scale. The transition involves substantial optical and structural changes in a highly compressed form. Thermochromism is also studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry and fluorescence intensity measurements, and reveals that ultrathin films can reversibly attain an intermediate phase before irreversibly transforming to a final stable state. Further AFM studies also reveal the relation between the highly anisotropic film structure and its nanomechanical properties. In particular, friction at the nanometre scale depends dramatically upon the angle between the polymer backbone and the sliding direction, with the maximum found when sliding perpendicular to the backbones. The observed threefold anisotropy in mechanical dissipation also leads to contrast in the phase response of intermittent-contact AFM, indicating for the first time that in-plane anisotropy of polymeric systems in general can be investigated using this technique.},

	Abstract = {Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was originally conceived as a method for measuring atomic-scale surface topography. Over the last two decades, it has blossomed into an array of techniques that can be used to obtain a rich variety of information about nanoscale material properties. With the exception of friction measurements, these techniques have traditionally depended on tip-sample interactions directed normal to the sample's surface. Recently, researchers have explored several effects arising from interactions parallel to surfaces, usually by deliberately applying a modulated lateral displacement. In fact, some parallel motion is ubiquitous to cantilever-based SPM, due to the tilt of the cantilever. Recent studies, performed in contact, noncontact, and intermittent-contact modes, provide new insights into properties such as structural anisotropy, lateral interactions with surface features, nanoscale shear stress and contact mechanics, and in-plane energy dissipation. The understanding gained from interpreting this behaviour has consequences for all cantilever-based scanning probe microscopies.},

To reduce the effect of higher levels present in the transmon spectrum, we apply Gaussian and derivative-of-Gaussian envelopes to the in-phase and out-of-phase quadratures, respectively, and optimize over their relative amplitude. Using randomized benchmarking, we obtain a minimum average error per gate of 0.007 +/- 0.005 using 4-ns-wide pulses, which is limited by decoherence. This simple optimization technique works for multiple transmons coupled to a single microwave resonator in a quantum bus architecture.},

	Abstract = {The phase shift in amplitude-controlled dynamic atomic force microscopy (AFM) is shown to depend on the cantilever-sample tilt angle. For a silicon sample and tip the phase shift changes by nearly 15degrees for a change in tilt angle of 15degrees. This contribution to the phase results from the oscillating tip's motion parallel to the surface, which contributes to the overall energy dissipation. It occurs even when the measurements are carried out in the attractive regime. An off-axis dynamic AFM model incorporating van der Waals attraction and a thin viscous damping layer near the surface successfully describes the observed phase shifts. This effect must be considered to interpret phase images quantitatively. (C) 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

We use two different theoretical methods to calculate the Hilbert space structure in the presence of the inhomogeneous field: the Heitler-London method, which is carried out analytically, and the molecular orbital method. which is done computational ly. Within these approximations we show that the exchange energy J changes slowly when the coupled dots are subject to a magnetic field with a wide range of inhomogeneity, suggesting that swap operations can be performed in such an environment as long as quantum error correction is applied to account for the Zeeman term. We also point out the quantum interference nature of this slow variation in exchange.},

The heterostructures consist of layers of Si and SiGe, and anisotropic etching of the heterostructures using plasmas to isolate device elements is an attractive approach to fabricating devices. A challenge that has limited the use of fluorocarbon etching is the difference in Si and SiGe etch rates under comparative conditions. Preferential etching of SiGe can lead to undercutting beneath the top Si layer, causing a reduction in critical device dimensions of unknown magnitude. By using fluorocarbon etch gases with high carbon content, fluorocarbon sidewall passivation improves the anisotropy of etched feature profiles by preventing lateral etching of SiGe. Etch results with a C4F8/Ar/N-2 gas mixture show a straight sidewall profile through the layers of the heterostructure. (c) 2007 American Vacuum Society.},

Particles move in steps of 10 to 50 nm per cycle, and the particle motion is mass selective. Particle velocity is varied by changing the frequency of the wave form. Calculated inertial forces acting on the particles correspond closely to friction forces between individual microparticles and the substrate, as measured by coupling an individual particle to an atomic force microscope. The results provide insight into the characteristics of particle-surface interactions, and demonstrate the potential for controlled manipulation and separation of large collections of particles without the need for a fluid medium.

	Abstract = {Spin is a fundamental property of all elementary particles. Classically it can be viewed as a tiny magnetic moment, but a measurement of an electron spin along the direction of an external magnetic field can have only two outcomes(1): parallel or anti-parallel to the field. This discreteness reflects the quantum mechanical nature of spin. Ensembles of many spins have found diverse applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging(2) to magneto-electronic devices(3), while individual spins are considered as carriers for quantum information. Read-out of single spin states has been achieved using optical techniques(4), and is within reach of magnetic resonance force microscopy(5). However, electrical read-out of single spins(6-13) has so far remained elusive. Here we demonstrate electrical single-shot measurement of the state of an individual electron spin in a semiconductor quantum dot(14). We use spin-to-charge conversion of a single electron confined in the dot, and detect the single-electron charge using a quantum point contact; the spin measurement visibility is similar to65%. Furthermore, we observe very long single-spin energy relaxation times (up to similar to0.85 ms at a magnetic field of 8 T), which are encouraging for the use of electron spins as carriers of quantum information.},

Two quantum point contacts (QPCs) are placed in the vicinity of the double quantum dot and serve as charge detectors. These enable determination of the number of conduction electrons on each dot. This number can be reduced to zero, while still allowing transport measurements through the double dot. The coupling between the two dots can be controlled even in the few-electron regime. Microwave radiation is used to pump an electron from one dot to the other by absorption of a single photon. The experiments demonstrate that this quantum dot circuit can serve as a good starting point for a scalable spin-qubit system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The Toffoli gate is a three-quantum-bit (three-qubit) operation that inverts the state of a target qubit conditioned on the state of two control qubits. It makes universal reversible classical computation(1) possible and, together with a Hadamard gate(2), forms a universal set of gates in quantum computation. It is also a key element in quantum error correction schemes(3-7). The Toffoli gate has been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance(3), linear optics(8) and ion trap systems(9). Experiments with superconducting qubits have also shown significant progress recently: two-qubit algorithms(10) and two-qubit process tomography have been implemented(11), three-qubit entangled states have been prepared(12,13), first steps towards quantum teleportation have been taken(14) and work on quantum computing architectures has been done(15). Implementation of the Toffoli gate with only single-and two-qubit gates requires six controlled-NOT gates and ten single-qubit operations(16), and has not been realized in any system owing to current limits on coherence. Here we implement a Toffoli gate with three superconducting transmon qubits coupled to a microwave resonator. By exploiting the third energy level of the transmon qubits, we have significantly reduced the number of elementary gates needed for the implementation of the Toffoli gate, relative to that required in theoretical proposals using only two-level systems. Using full process tomography and Monte Carlo process certification, we completely characterize the Toffoli gate acting on three independent qubits, measuring a fidelity of 68.5 +/- 0.5 per cent. A similar approach(15) to realizing characteristic features of a Toffoli-class gate has been demonstrated with two qubits and a resonator and achieved a limited characterization considering only the phase fidelity. Our results reinforce the potential of macroscopic superconducting qubits for the implementation of complex quantum operations with the possibility of quantum error correction(17).},

	Abstract = {Electron states are studied for quantum dots in a strained Si quantum well, taking into account both valley and orbital physics. Realistic geometries are considered, including circular and elliptical dot shapes, parallel and perpendicular magnetic fields, and (most importantly for valley coupling) the small local tilt of the quantum-well interface away from the crystallographic axes. In absence of a tilt, valley splitting occurs only between pairs of states with the same orbital quantum numbers. However, tilting is ubiquitous in conventional silicon heterostructures, leading to valley-orbit coupling. In this context, "valley splitting" is no longer a well-defined concept, and the quantity of merit for qubit applications becomes the ground-state gap. For typical dots used as qubits, a rich energy spectrum emerges, as a function of magnetic field, tilt angle, and orbital quantum number. Numerical and analytical solutions are obtained for the ground-state gap and for the mixing fraction between the ground and excited states. This mixing can lead to valley scattering, decoherence, and leakage for Si spin qubits.},

The experimental results are largely reproduced by equivalent circuit analysis and Hubbard models.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

	Abstract = {Silicon has many attractive properties for quantum computing, and the quantum-dot architecture is appealing because of its controllability and scalability. However, the multiple valleys in the silicon conduction band are potentially a serious source of decoherence for spin-based quantum-dot qubits. Only when a large energy splits these valleys do we obtain well-defined and long-lived spin states appropriate for quantum computing. Here, we show that the small valley splittings observed in previous experiments on Si-SiGe heterostructures result from atomic steps at the quantum-well interface. Lateral confinement in a quantum point contact limits the electron wavefunctions to several steps, and enhances the valley splitting substantially, up to 1.5 meV. The combination of electrostatic and magnetic confinement produces a valley splitting larger than the spin splitting, which is controllable over a wide range. These results improve the outlook for realizing spin qubits with long coherence times in silicon-based devices.},

Real-time video images demonstrate the ability to manipulate individual nanowires in aqueous media by capturing them along the edges of electrodes, and using a slow fluid flow to transport them until they bridge across micron-sized electrode gaps. By using special cancellation schemes, we demonstrate that it is possible to eliminate the effects of background currents through the electrolyte, and to electrically detect the bridging of electrodes by individual nanowires and nanowire bundles. These results have been obtained using gold nanowires with diameters ranging from similar to 50 to 250 nm, similar to 50 nm diameter silicon nanowires, and similar to 70 nm diameter carbon nanofibres.},

In a magnetic field, applied parallel to the two-dimensional electron gas in which the quantum dot is defined, Zeeman splitting of the orbital states is directly observed by measurements of electron transport through the dot. By applying short voltage pulses, we can populate the excited spin state with one electron and monitor relaxation of the spin. We find a lower bound on T-1 of 50 mus at 7.5 T, only limited by our signal-to-noise ratio. A continuous measurement of the charge on the dot has no observable effect on the spin relaxation.},

@article{Hanson:2007p1217,
	Abstract = {The canonical example of a quantum-mechanical two-level system is spin. The simplest picture of spin is a magnetic moment pointing up or down. The full quantum properties of spin become apparent in phenomena such as superpositions of spin states, entanglement among spins, and quantum measurements. Many of these phenomena have been observed in experiments performed on ensembles of particles with spin. Only in recent years have systems been realized in which individual electrons can be trapped and their quantum properties can be studied, thus avoiding unnecessary ensemble averaging. This review describes experiments performed with quantum dots, which are nanometer-scale boxes defined in a semiconductor host material. Quantum dots can hold a precise but tunable number of electron spins starting with 0, 1, 2, etc. Electrical contacts can be made for charge transport measurements and electrostatic gates can be used for controlling the dot potential. This system provides virtually full control over individual electrons. This new, enabling technology is stimulating research on individual spins. This review describes the physics of spins in quantum dots containing one or two electrons, from an experimentalist's viewpoint. Various methods for extracting spin properties from experiment are presented, restricted exclusively to electrical measurements. Furthermore, experimental techniques are discussed that allow for (1) the rotation of an electron spin into a superposition of up and down, (2) the measurement of the quantum state of an individual spin, and (3) the control of the interaction between two neighboring spins by the Heisenberg exchange interaction. Finally, the physics of the relevant relaxation and dephasing mechanisms is reviewed and experimental results are compared with theories for spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions. All these subjects are directly relevant for the fields of quantum information processing and spintronics with single spins (i.e., single spintronics).},

Here, we present the results for Si SETs fabricated by our group (a different source) demonstrating their operation as SETs.

Specifically, we study the feasibility of P-2(+) charge qubits in Si, focusing on single qubit properties in terms of tunnel coupling between the two phosphorus donors and qubit decoherence caused by electron-phonon interaction. By taking into consideration the multivalley structure of the Si conduction band, we show that intervalley quantum interference has important consequences for single-qubit operations of P-2(+) charge qubits. In particular, the valley interference leads to a tunnel-coupling strength distribution centered around zero. On the other hand, we find that the Si band structure does not dramatically affect the electron-phonon coupling and consequently, qubit coherence. We also critically compare charge qubit properties for Si:P-2(+) and GaAs double quantum dot quantum computer architectures.},

Most experiments have focused on quantum dots made from III-V semiconductors; however, the coherence of electron spins in these materials is limited by hyperfine interactions with nuclear spins(3-6). Ge/Si core/ shell nanowires seem ideally suited to overcome this limitation, because the most abundant nuclei in Ge and Si have spin zero and the nanowires can be chemically synthesized defect-free with tunable properties(7). Here, we present a double quantum dot based on Ge/Si nanowires in which we can completely control the coupling between the dots and to the leads. We also demonstrate that charge on the double dot can be detected by coupling it capacitively to an adjacent nanowire quantum dot. The double quantum dot and integrated charge sensor serve as an essential building block to form a solid-state qubit free of nuclear spin.},

A magnetic field, perpendicular to the two-dimensional electron gas, reduces the extent of the electronic wave-function and thereby decreases the tunnel coupling. This magnetic field also modulates the orbital excitation energies in each individual dot. By additionally tuning the asymmetry of the double well potential we can align the chemical potentials of an excited state of one of the quantum dots and the ground state of the other quantum dot.

	Abstract = {Singlet-triplet spin blockade in a few-electron lateral double quantum dot is investigated using simultaneous transport and charge-sensing measurements. Transport from the (1,1) to the (0,2) electron occupancy states is strongly suppressed relative to the opposite bias [(0,2)-(1,1)]. At large bias, spin blockade ceases as the (0,2) triplet state enters the transport window, giving a direct measure of exchange splitting of the (0,2) state as a function of magnetic field. A simple model for current and steady-state charge distribution in spin-blockade conditions is developed and found to be in excellent agreement with experiment. Three other transitions [(1,1)-(2,0), (1,3)-(2,2), and (1,3)-(0,4)] exhibit spin blockade while other nearby transitions and opposite bias configurations do not, consistent with simple even-odd shell filling.},

	Abstract = {The spin of a confined electron, when oriented originally in some direction, will lose memory of that orientation after some time. Physical mechanisms leading to this relaxation of spin memory typically involve either coupling of the electron spin to its orbital motion or to nuclear spins(1-7). Relaxation of confined electron spin has been previously measured only for Zeeman or exchange split spin states, where spin-orbit effects dominate relaxation(8-10); spin flips due to nuclei have been observed in optical spectroscopy studies(11). Using an isolated GaAs double quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates and direct time domain measurements, we investigate in detail spin relaxation for arbitrary splitting of spin states. Here we show that electron spin flips are dominated by nuclear interactions and are slowed by several orders of magnitude when a magnetic field of a few millitesla is applied. These results have significant implications for spin-based information processing(12).},

	Abstract = {The controlled depletion of electrons in semiconductors is the basis for numerous devices. Reactive-ion etching provides an effective technique for fabricating both classical and quantum devices. However, Fermi-level pinning must be carefully considered in the development of small devices, such as quantum dots. Because of depletion, the electrical size of the device is reduced in comparison with its physical dimension. To investigate this issue in modulation-doped silicon single-electron transistors, we fabricate several types of devices in silicon-germanium heterostructures using two different etches, CF4 and SF6. We estimate the depletion width associated with each etch by two methods: (i) conductance measurements in etched wires of decreasing thickness (to determine the onset of depletion), and (ii) capacitance measurements of quantum dots (to estimate the size of the active region). We find that the SF6 etch causes a much smaller depletion width, making it more suitable for device fabrication. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

The effective Lande g-factor, g*, is determined both as a function of electron sheet concentration, n(s), and Landau level occupation number, nu. The value of g* is determined from the angle at which the longitudinal magnetoresistance minima of adjacent spin-split Landau levels are equal. For the coincidence of the nu = 6 and nu = 8 levels, g* increases from 2.9 +/- 0.1 to 3.8 +/- 0.2 as n, is decreased from 5.9 x 10(11) cm(-2) to 4.4 x 10(11) cm(-2) at T = 0.4 K. In the same sample, with fixed electron concentration of n(s) = 4.1 x 10(11) cm(-2), g* approximate to 3.5 for nu greater than or similar to 10, and oscillates between average values of 2.6 +/- 0.1 and 4.2 +/- 0.2, for lower values of v. The magnitude of the valley splittings has also been investigated; for a perpendicular magnetic field of similar to 2.8 T, a splitting of 52 +/- 11 mu eV is determined, which is several times smaller than values for Si inversion layers reported in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Several logical qubits and quantum gates have been proposed for semiconductor quantum dots controlled by voltages applied to top gates. The different schemes can be difficult to compare meaningfully. Here we develop a theoretical framework to evaluate disparate qubit-gating schemes on an equal footing. We apply the procedure to two types of double-dot qubits: the singlet--triplet and the semiconducting quantum dot hybrid qubit. We investigate three quantum gates that flip the qubit state: a DC pulsed gate, an AC gate based on logical qubit resonance, and a gate-like process known as stimulated Raman adiabatic passage. These gates are all mediated by an exchange interaction that is controlled experimentally using the interdot tunnel coupling g and the detuning ϵ, which sets the energy difference between the dots. Our procedure has two steps. First, we optimize the gate fidelity (f) for fixed g as a function of the other control parameters; this yields an  that is universal for different types of gates. Next, we identify physical constraints on the control parameters; this yields an upper bound  that is specific to the qubit-gate combination. We show that similar gate fidelities  should be attainable for singlet-triplet qubits in isotopically purified Si, and for hybrid qubits in natural Si. Considerably lower fidelities are obtained for GaAs devices, due to the fluctuating magnetic fields ΔB produced by nuclear spins.},

In combination with the recently demonstrated controlled exchange gate between two neighbouring spins, driven coherent single spin rotations would permit universal quantum operations. Here, we report the experimental realization of single electron spin rotations in a double quantum dot. First, we apply a continuous-wave oscillating magnetic field, generated on-chip, and observe electron spin resonance in spin-dependent transport measurements through the two dots. Next, we coherently control the quantum state of the electron spin by applying short bursts of the oscillating magnetic field and observe about eight oscillations of the spin state ( so-called Rabi oscillations) during a microsecond burst. These results demonstrate the feasibility of operating single-electron spins in a quantum dot as quantum bits.},

These properties are well understood from a theoretical expression that we derive here in the static limit for the nuclear bath.

We have measured Coulomb oscillations in the conductance and the Coulomb staircase in current-voltage characteristics and studied their dependence on the conductances of the tunnel barriers. We show experimentally that at zero magnetic field charging effects start to affect the transport properties when both barrier conductances are smaller than the first quantized conductance value of a point contact at 2e2/h.

The measurement of current versus source-drain voltage and gate voltage is used as a spectroscopic tool to investigate the energy characteristics of interacting electrons confined to a small region in a semiconducting material. Three energy scales are distinguished: the single-particle states, which are discrete due to the confinement involved; the direct Coulomb interaction between electron charges on the dot; and the exchange interaction between electrons with parallel spins. To disentangle these energies, a magnetic field is used to reorganize the occupation of electrons over the single-particle states and to induce changes in the spin states. We discuss the interactions between small numbers of electrons (between 1 and 20) using the simplest possible models. Nevertheless, these models consistently describe a large set of experiments. Some of the observations resemble similar phenomena in atomic physics, such as shell structure and periodic table characteristics, Hund's rule, and spin singlet and triplet states. The experimental control, however, is much larger than for atoms: with one device all the artificial elements can be studied by adding electrons to the quantum dot when changing the gate voltage.},

	Abstract = {Initialization, two-spin coherent manipulation, and readout of a three-spin qubit are demonstrated using a few-electron triple quantum dot. The three-spin qubit is designed to allow all operations for full qubit control to be tuned via nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. Fast readout of charge states takes advantage of multi-plexed reflectometry. Decoherence measured in a two-spin subspace is found to be consistent with predictions based on gate voltage noise with a uniform power spectrum. The theory of the exchange-only qubit is developed and it is shown that initialization of only two spins suffices for operation. Requirements for full multi-qubit control using only exchange and electrostatic interactions are outlined.},

	Abstract = {This article reviews the history and current progress in high-mobility strained Si, SiGe, and Ge channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs). We start by providing a chronological overview of important milestones and discoveries that have allowed heterostructures grown on Si substrates to transition from purely academic research in the 1980's and 1990's to the commercial development that is taking place today. We next provide a topical review of the various types of strain-engineered MOSFETs that can be integrated onto relaxed Si1-xGex, including surface-channel strained Si n- and p-MOSFETs, as well as double-heterostructure MOSFETs which combine a strained Si surface channel with a Ge-rich buried channel. In all cases, we will focus on the connections between layer structure, band structure, and MOS mobility characteristics. Although the surface and starting substrate are composed of pure Si, the use of strained Si still creates new challenges, and we shall also review the literature on short-channel device performance and process integration of strained Si. The review concludes with a global summary of the mobility enhancements available in the SiGe materials system and a discussion of implications for future technology generations.

In the absence of piezoelectric phonon coupling, spontaneous phonon emission with deformation-potential coupling accounts for inelastic tunneling through the ground states of the two dots. Such transport measurements enable us to observe a Pauli spin blockade due to effective two-electron spin-triplet correlations, evident in a distinct bias-polarity dependence of resonant tunneling through the ground states. The blockade is lifted by the excited-state resonance by virtue of efficient phonon emission between the ground states. Our experiment demonstrates considerable potential for investigating silicon-based spin dynamics and spin-based quantum information processing.},

As the tunnel conductance between the two dots is increased from near zero to 2e (2)/h (where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant), the measured conductance peaks of the double dot exhibit pronounced changes in agreement with many-body theory.},

	Abstract = {The control factors controlling the growth of native silicon oxide on silicon (Si) surfaces have been identified. The coexistence of oxygen and water or moisture is required for growth of native oxide both in air and in ultrapure water at room temperature. Layer‐by‐layer growth of native oxide films occurs on Si surfaces exposed to air. Growth of native oxides on n‐Si in ultrapure water is described by a parabolic law, while the native oxide film thickness on n+‐Si in ultrapure water saturates at 10 {\AA}. The native oxide growth on n‐Si in ultrapure water is continuously accompanied by a dissolution of Si into the water and degrades the atomic flatness at the oxide‐Si interface, producing a rough oxide surface. A dissolution of Si into the water has not been observed for the Si wafer having surface covered by the native oxide grown in air. Native oxides grown in air and in ultrapure de‐ionized water have been demonstrated experimentally to exhibit remarkable differences such as contact angles of ultrapure water drops and chemical binding energy. These chemical bond structures for native oxide films grown in air and in ultrapure water are also discussed.},

Gas molecules surrounding suspended SWNTs assist the relaxation of hot phonons and afford enhanced current flow along nanotubes. Molecular solids of carbon dioxide frozen onto suspended SWNTs quench the nonequilibrium phonon effect. The discovery of strong environmental effects on high current transport in nanotubes is important to high performance nanoelectronics applications of 1D nanowires in general.},

This result is unexpected, as IC-AFM has previously only been considered as a probe of out-of-plane properties. Until now, AFM measurements of nanoscale in-plane properties have employed contact mode techniques. In-plane property measurements are possible with intermittent contact AFM because there is a small but significant component of tip motion parallel to the sample surface. This in-plane component of tip displacement is virtually universal in AFM, implying that oscillating-tip techniques generally are sensitive to in-plane material properties. We present a simple Hertzian model of intermittent-contact AFM that includes such an in-plane displacement. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Optoelectronic measurements of carbon nanotube transistors have shown a wide variety of sensitivites to the incident light. Direct photocurrent processes compete with a number of extrinsic mechanisms. Here we show that visible light absorption in the silicon substrate generates a photovoltage that can electrically gate the nanotube device. The photocurrent induced by the changing gate voltage can be significantly larger than that due to direct electron-hole pair generation in the nanotube. The dominance of photogating in these devices is confirmed by the power and position dependence of the resulting photocurrent. The power dependence is strongly nonlinear and photocurrents are measured through the device even when the laser illuminates up to 1 mm from the nanotube. (c) 2006 American Institute of Physics.},

However, biomolecular recognition processes, such as DNA hybridization and protein binding, typically operate in highly conducting, aqueous saline solutions. Here, we report investigations of the manipulation and real-time detection of individual nanowires bridging microelectrode gaps in saline solutions. Measurements of the electrode impedance versus frequency show a crossover in behavior at a critical frequency that is dependent on the ionic strength. We demonstrate that by operating above this critical frequency, it is possible to use dielectrophoresis to manipulate nanowires across electrode gaps in saline solutions. By using electrical ground planes and nulling schemes to reduce the background currents, we further demonstrate the ability to electrically detect bridging and unbridging events of individual nanowires in saline solutions. The ability to both manipulate and detect bridging events with electrical signals provides a pathway toward automated assembly of nanoscale devices that incorporate biomolecular recognition elements.},

Depending on the qubit design, dielectric loss from insulating materials or the tunnel junction can lead to short coherence times. We show that a variety of microwave and qubit measurements are well modeled by loss from resonant absorption of two-level defects. Our results demonstrate that this loss can be significantly reduced by using better dielectrics and fabricating junctions of small area less than or similar to 10 mu m(2). With a redesigned phase qubit employing low-loss dielectrics, the energy relaxation rate has been improved by a factor of 20, opening up the possibility of multiqubit gates and algorithms.},

	Abstract = {We analyze transport data from a quantum point contact (QPC), fabricated on a modulation doped Si/SiGe heterostructure, to extract experimental estimates for the valley splitting. The experimental data are fit to a form derived from a valley coupling theory that takes into account the fact that the quantum well is grown on a miscut substrate. The results of the fitting analysis are compared to the results obtained by fitting to a simple phenomenological form; both methods indicate that electrostatic confinement and magnetic confinement enhance the valley splitting by reducing the lateral spatial extent of the electronic wavefunction. Consequently, the valley splitting can be much larger than the spin splitting for small magnetic fields. We observe different valley splittings for the two lowest orbital modes of the QPC, supporting the notion that when steps are present at the quantum well interface the spatial extent of the wavefunction plays a dominant role in determining the valley splitting.},

Control via the exchange interaction is fast, yielding a demonstrated 75 qubit rotations in less than 2 ns. Measurement and state tomography are performed using a maximum-likelihood estimator method, allowing decoherence, leakage out of the qubit state space, and measurement fidelity to be quantified.

These surface characteristics are always determined by the conditions of the final high-temperature process, except for QOX, which will never increase in neutral ambients. In all atmospheres, higher annealing temperatures yield lower QOX values. It was also found that the NSS values are very sensitive toward trace amounts of water in the high-temperature ambient. They decrease for increasing water vapor pressure. Effects of other impurities were not observed in this study. Based on saturation values and kinetic data a discussion is given of some models for both types of centers.},

Simulations show that the charge transfer signals are typically \Delta q > 0.2 e - over an order of magnitude larger than achievable with metallic SETs on the SiO2 surface. A complete spin-based qubit structure is obtained by adding a local Electron Spin Resonance line for coherent spin control.

Both the valley and spin splittings oscillate as a function of the QW width due to intervalley reflection of the electron wave off the interfaces.

Electrical control instead of magnetic control is particularly appealing for this purpose, because electric fields are easy to generate locally on-chip. We experimentally realized coherent control of a single-electron spin in a quantum dot using an oscillating electric field generated by a local gate. The electric field induced coherent transitions (Rabi oscillations) between spin-up and spin-down with 90 rotations as fast as similar to 55 nanoseconds. Our analysis indicated that the electrically induced spin transitions were mediated by the spin-orbit interaction. Taken together with the recently demonstrated coherent exchange of two neighboring spins, our results establish the feasibility of fully electrical manipulation of spin qubits.},

We performed electric dipole spin resonance experiments in the continuous wave (CW) and pump-and-pobe modes. We observed two resonant CW peaks and two Rabi oscillations of the quantum dot current by sweeping an external magnetic field at a fixed frequency. Two peaks and oscillations are measured at different resonant magnetic field, which reflects the fact that the local magnetic fields at each quantum dot are modulated by the stray field of a micromagnet. As predicted with a density matrix approach, the CW current is quadratic with respect to microwave (MW) voltage while the Rabi frequency (nu(Rabi)) is linear. The difference between the nu(Rabi) values of two Rabi oscillations directly reflects the MW electric field across the two dots. These results show that the spins on each dot can be manipulated coherently at will by tuning the micromagnet alignment and MW electric field.},

	Abstract = {We present here a two-step strategy for micropatterning proteins on a substrate to control neurite growth in culture. First, conventional microcontact printing is used to prepare a micropattern of protein A, which binds the Fc fragment of immunoglobulins. Then, a chimeric protein, consisting of the extracellular domain of a guidance protein recombinantly linked to the Fc fragment of IgG (prepared using conventional molecular techniques), is applied from solution. The chimeric protein binds to the patterned protein A, taking on its geometric pattern. Using this method, we have micropatterned the extracellular domain of the cell adhesion molecule, L1 (as an L1-Fc chimera) and demonstrated that it retains its ability to selectively guide axonal growth. L1-Fc micropatterned on a background of poly-L-lysine resulted in selective growth of the axons on the micropattern, whereas the somata and dendrites were unresponsive. Substrates bearing simultaneous micropatterns of L1-Fc and poly-L-lysine on a background of untreated glass were also created. Using this approach, cell body position was controlled by manipulating the dimensions of the poly-L-lysine pattern, and the dendrites were constrained to the poly-L-lysine pattern, while the axons grew preferentially on L1-Fc. The two-step microcontact printing method allows preparation of substrates that contain guidance proteins in geometric patterns with resolution of similar to1 mum. This method should be broadly applicable to many classes of proteins.},

	Abstract = {The potential of graphene-based materials consisting of one or a few layers of graphite for integrated electronics originates from the large room-temperature carrier mobility in these systems (similar to 10,000 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)). However, the realization of electronic devices such as field-effect transistors will require controlling and even switching offthe electrical conductivity by means of gate electrodes, which is made difficult by the absence of a bandgap in the intrinsic material. Here, we demonstrate the controlled induction of an insulating state-with large suppression of the conductivity-in bilayer graphene, by using a double-gate device configuration that enables an electric field to be applied perpendicular to the plane. The dependence of the resistance on temperature and electric field, and the absence of any effect in a single-layer device, strongly suggest that the gate-induced insulating state originates from the recently predicted opening of a bandgap between valence and conduction bands.},

	Abstract = {A study of donor electron spins and spin-dependent electronic transitions involving phosphorous (P-31) atoms in proximity to the (111) oriented crystalline silicon (c-Si) to silicon dioxide (SiO2) interface is presented for [P-31] = 10(15) cm(-3) and [P-31] = 10(16) cm(-3) at about liquid-He-4 temperatures (T = 5-15 K). Using pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance (pEDMR), spin-dependent transitions between the P-31 donor state and two distinguishable interface states are observed, namely, (i) P-b centers, which can be identified by their characteristic anisotropy, and (ii) a more isotropic center which is attributed to E' defects of the SiO2 bulk close to the interface. Correlation measurements of the dynamics of spin-dependent recombination confirm that previously proposed transitions between P-31 and the interface defects take place. The influence of these electronic near-interface transitions on the P-31 donor spin-coherence time T-2 as well as the donor spin-lattice relaxation time T-1 is then investigated by comparison of spin Hahn-echo decay measurements obtained from conventional bulk sensitive pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance and surface sensitive pEDMR, as well as surface sensitive electrically detected inversion recovery experiments. The measurements reveal that the T-2 times of both interface states and P-31 donor electron spins in proximity to them are consistently shorter than the T-1 times, and both T-2 and T-1 times of the near-interface donors are reduced by several orders of magnitude from those in the bulk, at T <= 13 K. The T-2 times of the P-31 donor electrons are in agreement with the prediction by de Sousa that they are limited by interface-defect induced field noise.},

	Abstract = {Electron spins trapped in quantum dots have been proposed as basic building blocks of a future quantum processor(1-3). Although fast, 180-picosecond, two-quantum-bit (two-qubit) operations can be realized using nearest-neighbour exchange coupling(4), a scalable, spin-based quantum computing architecture will almost certainly require long-range qubit interactions. Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) allows spatially separated superconducting qubits to interact via a superconducting microwave cavity that acts as a 'quantum bus', making possible two-qubit entanglement and the implementation of simple quantum algorithms(5-7). Here we combine the cQED architecture with spin qubits by coupling an indium arsenide nanowire double quantum dot to a superconducting cavity(8,9). The architecture allows us to achieve a charge-cavity coupling rate of about 30 megahertz, consistent with coupling rates obtained in gallium arsenide quantum dots(10). Furthermore, the strong spin-orbit interaction of indium arsenide allows us to drive spin rotations electrically with a local gate electrode, and the charge-cavity interaction provides a measurement of the resulting spin dynamics. Our results demonstrate how the cQED architecture can be used as a sensitive probe of single-spin physics and that a spin-cavity coupling rate of about one megahertz is feasible, presenting the possibility of long-range spin coupling via superconducting microwave cavities.},

Solid-state electrical devices possess great potential to scale up such demonstrations from few-qubit control to larger-scale quantum processors. Coherent control of spin qubits has been achieved in lithographically defined double quantum dots in both GaAs (refs 3-5) and Si (ref. 6). However, it is a formidable challenge to combine the electrical measurement capabilities of engineered nanostructures with the benefits inherent in atomic spin qubits. Here we demonstrate the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin qubit bound to a phosphorus donor atom in natural silicon, measured electrically via single-shot read-out(7-9). We use electron spin resonance to drive Rabi oscillations, and a Hahn echo pulse sequence reveals a spin coherence time exceeding 200 mu s. This time should be even longer in isotopically enriched Si-28 samples(10,11). Combined with a device architecture(12) that is compatible with modern integrated circuit technology, the electron spin of a single phosphorus atom in silicon should be an excellent platform on which to build a scalable quantum computer.},

In the light of recent determinations of thecomposition and width of this interfacial transition region, a reexamination ofthe nature of this charge is undertaken. A model, consistent with knowntransition region composition, is proposed in which a positively charged silicon-oxygencomplex is formed as an intermediate reaction product of the oxidationprocess. This intermediate may be trapped within the transition regionwhen the oxidation reaction is terminated by quenching in the oxidizingambient. The concentration of this complex is proportional both to the excessoxygen concentration and to the nonoxidized SiSi bond density in the transitionregion. The model is also consistent with the dependence of Qss on suchfactors as oxidant pressure, oxidation temperature, inert-gas annealing, andsubstrate orientation.},

It has two surface state bands (1) anti-bonding pi* band, which has acceptor states and (2) bonding pi band, which has donor states. Furthermore, due to its asymmetric dimer reconstruction, transport through this surface can be considered in two distinct directions, i.e. along and perpendicular to the paired dimer rows. We calculate transmission through these surface states and find that transmission along the dimer row direction is quite large due to strong orbital hybridization in this direction. Additionally, we calculate transmission through weakly interacting dangling bond wires along and perpendicular to the dimer row direction.},

	Abstract = {Strain plays a critical role in the properties of materials. In silicon and silicon - germanium, strain provides a mechanism for control of both carrier mobility and band offsets. In materials integration, strain is typically tuned through the use of dislocations and elemental composition. We demonstrate a versatile method to control strain by fabricating membranes in which the final strain state is controlled by elastic strain sharing, that is, without the formation of defects. We grow Si/SiGe layers on a substrate from which they can be released, forming nanomembranes. X-ray-diffraction measurements confirm a final strain predicted by elasticity theory. The effectiveness of elastic strain to alter electronic properties is demonstrated by low-temperature longitudinal Hall-effect measurements on a strained-silicon quantum well before and after release. Elastic strain sharing and film transfer offer an intriguing path towards complex, multiple-layer structures in which each layer's properties are controlled elastically, without the introduction of undesirable defects.},

	Abstract = {We report an efficient scheme for evaluating the quasiparticle corrections to local-density-approximation (LDA) band structures within the GW approximation. In this scheme, the GW self-energy corrections are evaluated in a sufficiently flexible Gaussian orbital basis set instead of using plane-wave Fourier representations of the relevant two-point functions. It turns out that this set has to include orbitals up to f-type symmetry, when in the LDA calculations Gaussian orbitals up to d-type symmetry are needed for convergence. For bulk Si, both schemes yield virtually identical quasiparticle band structures and the demand on computer time is roughly the same. For the Si(001)-(2x1) surface, the GW Gaussian orbital scheme is a factor of 5 faster. In bur calculations for Si(001)-(2x1) the dynamic dielectric matrix is obtained by applying a plasmon-pole approximation. The static dielectric matrix of the Si(001) surface is fully calculated within the random-phase approximation (RPA). In addition, we have performed quasiparticle surface band-structure calculations employing two model dielectric matrices. Our respective results are compared with those obtained employing the full RPA dielectric matrix as well as with results of previous calculations by other authors which were based on model dielectric matrices.},

	Abstract = {A nontraditional fabrication technique is used to produce quantum dots with read-out channels in silicon/silicon-germanium two-dimensional electron gases. The technique utilizes Schottky gates, placed on the sides of a shallow etched quantum dot, to control the electronic transport process. An adjacent quantum point contact gate is integrated to the side gates to define a read-out channel, and thus allow for noninvasive detection of the electronic occupation of the quantum dot. Reproducible and stable Coulomb oscillations and the corresponding jumps in the read-out channel resistance are observed at low temperatures. The fabricated dot combined with the read-out channel represents a step toward the spin-based quantum bit in Si/SiGe heterostructures. (c) 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Silicon-based heterostructures have come a long way from the discovery of strain as a new and essential parameter for band structure engineering to the present state of electron and hole mobilities, which surpass those achieved in the traditional Si/SiO2 material combination by more than an order of magnitude and are rapidly approaching the best III-V heteromaterials: It is the purpose of this article to report on the most recent developments, and the performance level achieved to date in this material system, in a concise and critical manner. The first part of this review is concerned with the structural and electronic properties of the lattice-mismatched Si/SiGe heterostructure. Emphases are put on the effects of strain both on the band structure and on the band offsets, as well as on means to actually control the strain in a stack of heteroepitaxial layers. The second part is dedicated to the transport properties of low-dimensional carrier systems in Si/SiGe and Ge/SiGe heterostructures. The prospects and limitations of the different layer concepts are discussed in terms of scattering mechanisms and experimental results. This part also reviews the most recent magneto-transport experiments on quantum wires and quantum point contacts, which became possible by the enhanced mean free paths in these materials. The third part covers the device aspects of these high-mobility materials, which is of special interest, because silicon-based heterostructures can significantly enhance the performance level of contemporary Si devices without sacrificing the essential compatibility with standard Si technologies. The recent achievements in this application-driven research field, but also the foreseeable problems and limitations, are discussed, and an assessment of the possible role of such heterodevices in future microelectronic circuits is given.},

When tilting the sample in the magnetic field the value of the spin splitting increases with respect to the Landau level splitting leading to an overlap of spin-split sub-levels of different Landau levels, the so-called coincidences. Coincidences between up to live neighbouring Landau levels are found. From their positions we deduce a Lande factor g* approximate to 3.4. Coincidences between the lowest Landau levels with fully resolved individual valley states show extremely high SdH peaks compared to the individual SdH maxima outside the coincidence suggesting strong exchange enhancement effects in the occurrence of the coincidence.

The electronic states of this dopant isolated in the channel appear as resonances in the low temperature conductance at energies below the conduction band edge. We observe the two possible charge states successively occupied by spin-up and spin-down electrons under magnetic field. The first resonance is consistent with the binding energy of the neutral D-0 state of an arsenic donor. The second resonance shows a reduced charging energy due to the electrostatic coupling of the charged D- state with electrodes. Excited states and Zeeman splitting under magnetic field present large energies potentially useful to build atomic scale devices.},

Dielectrophoretic manipulation with a 1 MHz AC voltage is used to manipulate biotin-modified nanowires into the inter-electrode gap. Biomolecular recognition between the biotin-modified nanowires and the avidin-modified gold microelectrodes then holds the nanowires securely in place. By simultaneously applying a second, lower-frequency AC voltage and using lock-in detection, we are able to monitor individual bridging events in real time and to characterize the change in electrical response associated with individual nanowire bridges. The combined use of physical manipulation with biomolecular recognition can be used for selective assembly of nanoscale materials, as well as analytical application as a biologically activated switch in which an electrical contact is controlled by a biomolecular recognition process.},

	Abstract = {While electron spins in silicon heterostructures make attractive qubits, little is known about the coherence of electrons at the Si/SiO2 interface. We report spin relaxation (T-1) and coherence (T-2) times for mobile electrons and natural quantum dots at a Si-28/SiO2 interface. Mobile electrons have short T-1 and T-2 of 0.3 mu s at 5 K. In line with predictions, confining electrons and cooling increases T-1 to 0.8 ms at 350 mK. In contrast, T-2 for quantum dots is around 10 mu s at 350 mK, increasing to 30 mu s when the dot density is reduced by a factor of two. The quantum dot T-2 is shorter than T-1, indicating that T-2 is not controlled by T-1 at 350 mK but is instead limited by an extrinsic mechanism. The evidence suggests that this extrinsic mechanism is an exchange interaction between electrons in neighboring dots.},

Most manipulations of electron spins in quantum dots have focused on the construction and control of two-state quantum systems, or qubits, in which each quantum dot is occupied by a single electron. Here we perform quantum manipulations on a system with three electrons per double quantum dot. We demonstrate that tailored pulse sequences can be used to induce coherent rotations between three-electron quantum states. Certain pulse sequences yield coherent oscillations fast enough that more than 100 oscillations are visible within a T2* time. The minimum oscillation frequency we observe is faster than 5{\^a}€‰GHz. The presence of the third electron enables very fast rotations to all possible states, in contrast to the case when only two electrons are used, in which some rotations are slow.},

This may not be true when quantum mechanics is taken into consideration. This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems which are generally thought to be hard on a classical computer and which have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, e.g., the number of digits of the integer to be factored.},

	Abstract = {The ability to integrate carbon nanotubes, especially single-walled carbon nanotubes, seamlessly onto silicon would expand their range of applications considerably. Though direct integration using chemical vapor deposition is the simplest method, the growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes on bare silicon and on ultrathin oxides is greatly inhibited due to the formation of a noncatalytic silicide. Using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that silicide formation occurs on ultrathin oxides due to thermally activated metal diffusion through the oxide. Silicides affect the growth of single-walled nanotubes more than multi-walled nanotubes due to the increased kinetics at the higher single-walled nanotube growth temperature. We demonstrate that nickel and iron catalysts, when deposited on clean silicon or ultrathin silicon dioxide layers, begin to form silicides at relatively low temperatures, and that by 900 degrees C, all of the catalyst has been incorporated into the silicide, rendering it inactive for subsequent single-walled nanotube growth. We further show that a 4-nm silicon dioxide layer is the minimum diffusion barrier thickness that allows for efficient single-walled nanotube growth.},

	Abstract = {Exposing single-walled carbon nanotubes to room-temperature UV-generated ozone leads to an irreversible increase in their electrical resistance. We demonstrate that the increased resistance is due to ozone oxidation on the sidewalls of the nanotubes rather than at the end caps. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies show an increase in the defect density due to the oxidation of the nanotubes. Using ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, we show that these defects represent the removal of pi-conjugated electron states near the Fermi level, leading to the observed increase in electrical resistance. Oxidation of carbon nanotubes is an important first step in many chemical functionalization processes. Because the oxidation rate can be controlled with short exposures, UV-generated ozone offers the potential for use as a low-thermal-budget processing tool.},

Further suppression of the leakage is achieved by increasing the etch depth of the channel.

Owing to its potential compatibility with existing microelectronics, the proposal by Kane(7,8) - on the basis of phosphorus donors in silicon - has been pursued intensively(9-11). A key issue of this concept is the readout of the P-31 quantum state. Electrical measurements of magnetic resonance have been carried out on single spins(12,13), but the statistical nature of these experiments based on random-telegraph-noise measurements has impeded the readout of single spin states. Here, we demonstrate the measurement of the spin state of P-31 donor electrons in silicon and the observation of Rabi flops by purely electric means, that is by coherent manipulation of spin-dependent charge-carrier recombination between the P-31 donor and paramagnetic localized states at the Si/SiO2 interface. The electron spin information is shown to be coupled through the hyperfine interaction to the P-31 nucleus, suggesting that recombination-based readout of nuclear spins is feasible.},

The Schrodinger equation is reduced from 3D to multicomponent 2D and solved via an eigenfunction expansion in the dot. This permits the solution of the electronic structure for dot electron number N similar to 100. We present details of our derivation of the total dot-lead-gates interacting free energy in terms of the electronic structure results, which is free of capacitance parameters. Statistical properties of the dot level spacings and connection coefficients to the leads are computed in the presence of varying degrees of order in the donor layer. Based on the self-consistently computed free energy as a function of gate voltages, V-i, and N, we modify the semiclassical expression for the tunneling conductance as a function of gate voltage through the dot in the linear source-drain, Coulomb blockade regime. Among the many results presented, we demonstrate the existence of a shell structure in the dot levels which (a) results in envelope modulation of Coulomb oscillation peak heights, (b) influences the dot capacitances and should be observable in terms of variations in the activation energy for conductance in a Coulomb oscillation minimum, and (c) possibly contributes to departure of recent experimental results from the predictions of random-matrix theory.},

Because this mapping provides the transitions associated with a precise chiral wrapping of a particular nanotube, it allows the monitoring of reaction pathways that are selective to the nanotube chirality vector. This is demonstrated using a model electron-transfer reaction of 4-chlorobenzenediazonium shown to be selective for metallic over semiconducting carbon nanotubes via charge-transfer stabilization of complexes at the surfaces of the former.},

	Abstract = {Direct phonon spin-lattice relaxation of an electron qubit bound by a donor impurity or quantum dot in SiGe heterostructures is investigated. The aim is to evaluate the importance of decoherence from this mechanism in several important solid-state quantum computer designs operating at low temperatures. We calculate the relaxation rate 1/T-1 as a function of [100] uniaxial strain, temperature, magnetic field, and silicon/germanium content for Si:P bound electrons and quantum dots. The quantum dot potential is much smoother, leading to smaller splittings of the valley degeneracies. We have estimated these splittings in order to obtain upper bounds for the relaxation rate. In general, we find that the relaxation rate is strongly decreased by uniaxial compressive strain in a SiGe-Si-SiGe quantum well, making this strain an important positive design feature. Ge in high concentrations (particularly over 85%) increases the rate, making Si-rich materials preferable. We conclude that SiGe bound electron qubits must meet certain conditions to minimize decoherence but that spin-phonon relaxation does not rule out the solid-state implementation of error-tolerant quantum computing.},

The key parameter for these applications is the spin relaxation time. Here we apply the theory of D'yakonov and Perel' (DP) to calculate the electron spin resonance linewidth of a silicon 2DEG due to structural inversion asymmetry for arbitrary static magnetic field direction at low temperatures. We estimate the Rashba spin-orbit coupling coefficient in silicon quantum wells and find the T-1 and T-2 times of the spins from this mechanism as a function of momentum scattering time, magnetic field, and device-specific parameters. We obtain agreement with existing data for the angular dependence of the relaxation times and show that the magnitudes are consistent with the DP mechanism. We suggest how to increase the relaxation times by appropriate device design.},

	Abstract = {We propose that silicon-on-insulator (SOI) metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSEETs) with SOI films thinner than the inversion layer of the bulk MOSFETs can provide higher inversion-layer mobility than the bulk Si MOSFETs, because of the significant modulation of the subband structure due to the size effect of the ultrathin SOI films. In order to examine the effectiveness of this device structure on the mobility enhancement, a theoretical calculation of the inversion-layer mobility at room temperature is performed. It is found that the mobility of the SOI MOSFETs with a SOI thickness of around 3 nm can be higher than that of the bulk MOSFETs. This mobility enhancement is attributed to an increase in the occupancy of the 2-fold valleys and the suppression of inter-valley phonon scattering, associated with the energy splitting between the 2-fold and the 4-fold valleys due to the size effect of the SOI films.},

	Abstract = {Information processing using quantum systems provides new paradigms for computation and communication and may yield insights into our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics. However, realistic systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment, hence all quantum operations are subject to errors. Realization of a physical system for processing of quantum information that is tolerant of errors is a fundamental problem in quantum science and engineering. Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins by extending the Loss-DiVincenzo scheme and by combining actively protected quantum memory and long-distance coupling mechanisms. Our approach is based on a demonstrated encoding of qubits in long-lived two-electron states, which immunizes qubits against the dominant error from hyperfine interactions. We develop a universal set of quantum gates compatible with active error suppression for these encoded qubits and an effective long-range interaction between the qubits by controlled electron transport. This approach yields a scalable architecture with favourable error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation, consistent with present experimental parameters.},

Although electron transport in 2DEG nanostructures has been well studied, and many remarkable phenomena have already been discovered (for example, weak localization, quantum chaos, universal conductance fluctuations(1,2)), fundamental aspects of the electron flow through these structures have so far not been clarified. However, it has recently become possible to image current directly through 2DEG devices using scanning probe microscope techniques(3-13). Here, we use such a technique to observe electron flow through a narrow constriction in a 2DEG-a quantum point contact. The images show that the electron flow from the point contact forms narrow, branching strands instead of smoothly spreading fans. Our theoretical study of this flow indicates that this branching of current flux is due to focusing of the electron paths by ripples in the background potential. The strands are decorated by interference fringes separated by half the Fermi wavelength, indicating the persistence of quantum mechanical phase coherence in the electron flow. These findings may have important implications for a better understanding of electron transport in 2DEGs and for the design of future nanostructure devices.},

	Abstract = {We discuss pulsed electron spin resonance measurements of electrons in Si and determine the spin coherence from the decay of the spin echo signals. Tightly bound donor electrons in isotopically enriched Si-28 are found to have exceptionally long spin coherence. Placing the donors near a surface or interface is found to decrease the spin coherence time, but it is still in the range of milliseconds. Unbound two-dimensional electrons have shorter coherence times of a few microseconds, though still long compared to the Zeeman frequency or the typical time to manipulate a spin with microwave pulses. Longer spin coherence is expected in two-dimensional systems patterned into quantum dots, but relatively small dots will be required. Data from dots with a lithographic size of 400 nm do not yet show longer spin coherence. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), has been a favorite template for numerous research in a field of quantum physics during last several decades. While in the early stages the main efforts were devoted to fabricate extremely high-mobility 2DEG by concentrating on the purity of the grown material, nowadays it became clear that the further progress in the field requires new approaches of heterostructures design and the growth procedure. Here we report on the MBE growth of AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures using a short-period superlattice (SPSL) doping instead of the more standard n-AlGaAs doping. Such doping process allows the use of a low AlAs mole fraction spacer which, in turn, leads to a lower background of impurities as well as a better interface quality. Mobility exceeding 35 x 10(6) cm(2)/V S was measured in samples with doping introduced on both sides of a quantum well (QW) where the 2DEG was imbedded in. Most importantly the SPSL doping allows introducing "correlations" between ionized donors and allows controlling the potential disorder landscape that governs the appearance of various fractional quantum Hall states.

The field is oriented in the plane of the two-dimensional electron gas in which the dot is electrostatically defined. By combining the observation of Zeeman splitting with our knowledge of the absolute number of electrons, we are able to determine the ground state spin configuration for one to five electrons occupying the dot. For four electrons, we find a ground state spin configuration with total spin S = 1, in agreement with Hund's first rule.

	Abstract = {The number of steps any classical computer requires in order to rnd the prime factors of an l-digit integer N increases exponentially with l, at least using algorithms known at present(1). Factoring large integers is therefore conjectured to be intractable classically, an observation underlying the security of widely used cryptographic codes(1,2). Quantum computers(3), however, could factor integers in only polynomial time, using Shor's quantum factoring algorithm(4-6). Although important for the study of quantum computers(7), experimental demonstration of this algorithm has proved elusive(8-10). Here we report an implementation of the simplest instance of Shor's algorithm: factorization of N=15 (whose prime factors are 3 and 5). We use seven spin-1/2 nuclei in a molecule as quantum bits(11,12), which can be manipulated with room temperature liquid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. This method of using nuclei to store quantum information is in principle scalable to systems containing many quantum bits(13), but such scalability is not implied by the present work. The significance of our work lies in the demonstration of experimental and theoretical techniques for precise control and modelling of complex quantum computers. In particular, we present a simple, parameter-free but predictive model of decoherence effects(14) in our system.},

	Abstract = {One of the great successes of quantum physics is the description of the long-lived Rydberg states of atoms and ions. The Bohr model is equally applicable to donor impurity atoms in semiconductor physics, where the conduction band corresponds to the vacuum, and the loosely bound electron orbiting a singly charged core has a hydrogen-like spectrum according to the usual Bohr-Sommerfeld formula, shifted to the far-infrared due to the small effective mass and high dielectric constant. Manipulation of Rydberg states in free atoms and ions by single and multi-photon processes has been tremendously productive since the development of pulsed visible laser spectroscopy. The analogous manipulations have not been conducted for donor impurities in silicon. Here we use the FELIX pulsed free electron laser to perform time-domain measurements of the Rydberg state dynamics in phosphorus- and arsenic-doped silicon and we have obtained lifetimes consistent with frequency domain linewidths for isotopically purified silicon. This implies that the dominant decoherence mechanism for excited Rydberg states is lifetime broadening, just as for atoms in ion traps. The experiments are important because they represent the first step towards coherent control and manipulation of atomic-like quantum levels in the most common semiconductor and complement magnetic resonance experiments in the literature, which show extraordinarily long spin lattice relaxation times key to many well-known schemes for quantum computing qubits for the same impurities. Our results, taken together with the magnetic resonance data and progress in precise placement of single impurities, suggest that doped silicon, the basis for modern microelectronics, is also a model ion trap.},

	Abstract = {At the leading edge of a growing axon, the growth cone determines the path the axon takes and also plays a role in the formation of branches, decisions that are regulated by a complex array of chemical signals. Here, we used microfabrication technology to determine whether differences in substrate geometry, independent of changes in substrate chemistry, can modulate growth cone motility and branching, by patterning a polylysine grid of narrow (2 or 5 mu m wide) intersecting lines. The shape of the intersections varied from circular nodes 15 mu m in diameter to simple crossed lines (nodeless intersections). Time-lapse recordings of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that simple variations in substrate geometry changed growth cone shape, and altered the rate of growth and the probability of branching. When crossing onto a node intersection the growth cone paused, often for hours, and microtubutes appeared to defasciculate. Once beyond the node, filopodia and lamellipodia persisted at that site, sometimes forming a collateral branch. At nodeless intersections, the growth cone passed through with minimal hesitation, often becoming divided into separate areas of motility that led to the growth of separate branches. When several lines intersected at a common point, growth cones sometimes split into several subdivisions, resulting in the emergence of as many as five branches. Such experiments revealed an intrinsic preference for branches to form at angles less than 90 degrees. These data show that simple changes in the geometry of a chemically homogeneous substrate are detected by the growth cone and can regulate axonal growth and the formation of branches.

	Abstract = {The ability to manipulate and monitor a single-electron spin using electron spin resonance is a long-sought goal. Such control would be invaluable for nanoscopic spin electronics, quantum information processing using individual electron spin qubits and magnetic resonance imaging of single molecules. There have been several examples(1,2) of magnetic resonance detection of a single-electron spin in solids. Spin resonance of a nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond has been detected optically(3), and spin precession of a localized electron spin on a surface was detected(4,5) using scanning tunnelling microscopy. Spins in semiconductors are particularly attractive for study because of their very long decoherence times(6). Here we demonstrate electrical sensing of the magnetic resonance spin-flips of a single electron paramagnetic spin centre, formed by a defect in the gate oxide of a standard silicon transistor. The spin orientation is converted to electric charge, which we measure as a change in the source/drain channel current. Our set-up may facilitate the direct study of the physics of spin decoherence, and has the practical advantage of being composed of test transistors in a conventional, commercial, silicon integrated circuit. It is well known from the rich literature of magnetic resonance studies that there sometimes exist structural paramagnetic defects(7) near the Si/SiO2 interface. For a small transistor, there might be only one isolated trap state that is within a tunnelling distance of the channel, and that has a charging energy close to the Fermi level.},

	Abstract = {Silicon nanomembranes (SiNMs) are very thin, large, free-standing or free-floating two-dimensional (2D) single crystals that can variously be flat, rolled into tubes, or made into any number of odd shapes, cut into millions of identical wires, used as conformal sheets, or chopped into tiny pieces. Because SiNMs are mostly surface or interface and little bulk, they have very interesting properties. We describe electrical conductivity in SiNMs. Because of trap states at the Si/SiO2 interface, bulk dopants become irrelevant to electronic transport when the membrane is thin enough. Replacing the oxide at one interface with the clean-Si surface reconstruction dramatically increases the nanomembrane conductivity. We provide a model for this behaviour. The dimer reconstruction surface states provide a means of 'surface doping'. Other materials with proper highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) bands, when deposited on the Si surface, should produce the same conductivity effect, affording a broad opportunity for membrane-based sensors.},

	Abstract = {The widely used 'silicon-on-insulator' (SOI) system consists of a layer of single-crystalline silicon supported on a silicon dioxide substrate. When this silicon layer ( the template layer) is very thin, the assumption that an effectively infinite number of atoms contributes to its physical properties no longer applies, and new electronic, mechanical and thermodynamic phenomena arise(1-4), distinct from those of bulk silicon. The development of unusual electronic properties with decreasing layer thickness is particularly important for silicon microelectronic devices, in which (001)-oriented SOI is often used(5-7). Here we show - using scanning tunnelling microscopy, electronic transport measurements, and theory - that electronic conduction in thin SOI( 001) is determined not by bulk dopants but by the interaction of surface or interface electronic energy levels with the 'bulk' band structure of the thin silicon template layer. This interaction enables high-mobility carrier conduction in nanometre-scale SOI; conduction in even the thinnest membranes or layers of Si( 001) is therefore possible, independent of any considerations of bulk doping, provided that the proper surface or interface states are available to enable the thermal excitation of 'bulk' carriers in the silicon layer.},

An important step forward would be the ability to extract the characteristics of this noise from qubit measurements to see if it leads to new physical effects. For certain types of qubits, the working point of the qubit can be varied. Using a new mathematical method that is suited to treating all working points, we present theoretical results that show how this degree of freedom can be used to extract noise parameters and predict a new effect: noise-induced looping on the Bloch sphere. We analyze data on superconducting qubits to show that they are very near the parameter regime where this looping should be observed.},
